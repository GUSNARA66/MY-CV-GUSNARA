        Learning HTML Basics
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        In this section, I learned the basic structure of HTML such as
        headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. HTML helps me
        understand how a website is structured and organized.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        This knowledge is very important because HTML is the foundation
        of every website. Without HTML, a website cannot display content
        properly.

        Learning CSS Basics
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        CSS helps me design websites by managing colors, fonts, margins,
        padding, and layouts. I learned how to make websites more attractive
        and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        By combining HTML and CSS, I can create simple but clean and
        responsive websites.

        Learning Git & GitHub
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        Git allows me to manage project versions efficiently, while GitHub
        helps me store and share my projects online. This is very useful
        for collaboration and portfolio building.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        I use GitHub as a place to document my learning progress and
        showcase my projects.

        Understanding Tailwind 
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        Tailwind CSS helped me speed up my development process by using utility 
        classes. Instead of writing custom CSS from scratch, I can apply styling
        directly in HTML 
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        This method makes my code cleaner, more consistent, and easier to maintain,
        especially as a beginner

        My First Website Deployment
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        Deploying my first website was an exciting experience. I learned how 
        to publish my project online so it could be accessed by anyone through
        a web browser.  
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        This experience taught me the importance of testing, organizing files,
        and understanding how hosting platforms work.
